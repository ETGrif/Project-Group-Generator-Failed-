# Project-Group-Generator
This is just a little program made for my APCS teacher.
Given a roster of students and their grades, the
program generates any number of equally sized groups.
Each group will have an equal distrabution of grades
(so  that each group has a diverse range of "skill"
so no one team is the "smart team"), and avoids (to
the best of my ability) having students see the same
students over again. Hope you like it!

NOTE: There currently is not a Delete Project
functionality, so in order to delete a project:
*delete the text file(duh.)
*delete the line with said project's name in ProjectNames.txt
If you don't delete the line it will throw an error
while loading!
